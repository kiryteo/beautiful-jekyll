 Hello, my name is <strong>Ashwin Samudre</strong>, I am currently a research assistant in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medicalimageanalysis.com/">MIA group</a> at Simon Fraser University, Canada, under the supervision of Prof. Ghassan Hamarneh. I'm working on ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum) data analysis. Previously, I was a visitor at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/">EMBL Heidelberg</a> 
 in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.embl.de/research/units/cbb/kreshuk/members/index.php?s_personId=CP-60028565">Anna Kreshuk's</a> group where I worked on localization of Kinetochores (proteins in cell division process).
 Before that, I worked at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cinam.univ-mrs.fr/cinam/en/">CNRS CINAM</a> in Marseille, France as Research Engineer (contrat à durée déterminée) on development of automated pipeline for detection and classification of Red Blood Cells from blood flow recordings.
